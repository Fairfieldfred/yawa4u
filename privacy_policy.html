        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> [June 14, 2025]</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>YAWA4U ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we
            handle information when you use our mobile application (the "App").</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>The short version: We don't collect, store, or share any personal information about you.</strong>
        </div>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

        <p><strong>We collect NO personal information from users of our App.</strong></p>

        <p>We do collect anonymous usage data to improve our App, but this data is analytical data for usage, app
            crashes, or app malfunctions.</p>

        <p>Our App is designed to function completely anonymously without requiring or collecting any personal data,
            including but not limited to:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>No names, email addresses, or contact information</li>
            <li>No usernames or account credentials</li>
            <li>No location data or GPS information</li>
            <li>No photos, images, or media files</li>
            <li>No microphone or audio recordings</li>
            <li>No contact lists or address book information</li>
            <li>No device identifiers or advertising IDs</li>
            <li>No IP addresses or network information</li>
            <li>No cookies or tracking technologies</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Use Information</h2>

        <p>Since we collect no personal information, we do not use, process, or analyze any personal data from our
            users.</p>

        <h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>

        <p>We do not share, sell, rent, or disclose any personal information to third parties because we do not collect

        <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>

        <p>Since our App collects no personal data, there is no personal information stored on our servers or any
            third-party servers. The App functions entirely on your device without transmitting personal data.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

        <p>Our App does not integrate with any third-party services that would collect personal information on our
            behalf. If this changes in the future, we will update this Privacy Policy accordingly.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

        <p>Our App is safe for users of all ages, including children under 13, because we do not collect any personal
            information from anyone, regardless of age. We comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act
            (COPPA) by not collecting any personal information from children.</p>

        <h2>International Users</h2>

        <p>Since we collect no personal data, there are no cross-border data transfers or international privacy
            considerations.</p>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>

        <p>While we collect no personal information, you have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Know what information is collected (none in our case)</li>
            <li>Request deletion of information (not applicable as we collect none)</li>
            <li>Opt-out of data collection (not applicable as we collect none)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>California Privacy Rights</h2>

            personal information. Since we collect no personal information, these rights are not applicable to our App
            users.</p>

        <h2>European Union Users</h2>

        <p>Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), EU residents have specific rights regarding their
            personal data. Since we collect no personal information, GDPR data subject rights are not applicable to our
            App users.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes that would affect our
            data collection practices, we will notify users through the App or other appropriate means. The "Last
            Updated" date at the top of this policy will reflect when changes were made.</p>

        <h2>Analytics and Advertising</h2>

        <p>Our App does not use any analytics services or advertising networks that would collect personal information
            about users.</p>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
